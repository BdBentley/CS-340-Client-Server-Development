# CS-340-Client-Server-Development
Client server development course SNHU 


**    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**
    
By researching documentation and learning the syntax of different languages. It also helps to understand the modules and technology that you are working with. There are enough resources out there to help a Software developer learn to build clean and maintable code. Good code should be able to be followed without comments, but that is not an excuse to leave comments out of your work. It also helps just to follow for those who may not be familiar with the language. When writing the CRUD module in python it took just researching what CRUD stands for as well as the syntax for MongoDB. CRUD stands for "Create", "Read", "Update", and "Delete". It adds these simple functions to a module that interacts with a database.
    
**    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**
    
As a computer scientist I approach problems with logic and reasoning. It is more of an engineering philosophy than a pure science profession. What we do involves a lot of troubleshooting and researching new technologies and integrating them into our projects. The techniques we use are experimentation, just like you learn in 6th grade science class. I approached this project with Grazioso Salvare by writing the code for the CRUD module and then moving on to implementing authentication processes and test methods. Testing the software to ensure it performed as designed and was functional was a big part of this courses structure.
    
    
**    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Put very simply, Computer Scientists provide instructions for computers to interpret. How these instructions work and their actual intended function can range widely. From simple functions in a program that turn on and off LEDs to software that builds containers in cloud services for websites connecting people and customers around the world. Working on this project would help a company setup their database operations, it is easily transferrable to a cloud base environment as well if a customer did not want to maintain the infrastructure themselves.
